# Digital Pāḷi Dictionary online

This website features an online version of the [Digital Pāḷi Dictionary (DPD)](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/). The DPD is a novel Pāḷi dictionary in digital form only and distinguishes itself from the "classical" dictionaries
through its structured nature that allows reliable lookups of inflected forms, compounds and sandhis. It furthermore has an extensive reliance on the Pāḷi texts itself in that all proclaimed words and forms are matched to their occurrences
in the text. In this way, its degree of completion is measurable and the existence of the proclaimed inflections, etc. is verifiable. The DPD is originally available for GoldenDict and MDict applications and thus can be conveniently used on desktop computers as well as on smart phones.

This page gives users the additional opportunity to use the DPD through a web browser. It also adds to the search functionality compared GoldenDict of MDict as it enables sub string searches.

As the DPD represents a Pāḷi-English dictionary and simultaneously an English-Pāḷi dictionary, so does this online version of the DPD.

It furthermore provides a lookup URL which
delivers the corresponding entry of the DPD in HTML format if the word (headword or inflected form) is found. The lookup URL can be determined from clicking on a link in the search results. In order to use URL-based lookup, the sought word
simply has to be placed at the end of the URL.

However, the current version of the online DPD has some restrictions:

- It features only the core DPD dictionary and not the DPD-deconstructor or DPD-grammar dictionaries that are also part of the DPD.
- The lookup URL could in principle be used to integrate our Digital Pāḷi Dictionary online into a website-based dictionary in GoldenDict. However, probably due to certain shortcomings in the HTML delivered by our server GoldenDict refuses
to render the entries unless there is displayed another entry after it.
- The search functionality is still far from perfect as it limits the results to a few hundred findings without pagination.
- In contrast to GoldenDict, there is currently no support for navigating to a dictionary word via a link in an entry of the online version of the DPD.
