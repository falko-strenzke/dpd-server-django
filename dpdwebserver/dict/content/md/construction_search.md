# Search by Construction

The search by construction functionality for the DPD is still in an experimental stage. It allows you to enter a list of "tokens", i.e. mostly prefixes, a root, and suffixes as a comma-separated list (with or without spaces). An example would be "anu, âˆšgam". Then the search results will be the list of all
headwords that contain each of these tokens in the description of their construction. The constructions shown in the left column of the search results also feature the indication of phonetic changes using the ">" sign, but during the
search, only the original token (i.e., the leftmost one in the sequence separated by ">") is considered.

The auto completion will propose all of the valid tokens that are found within the non-compound headwords. Compounds cannot be found by this search.
